787840611869073408,2016-10-17 02:20:13,@AlwaysaGoodday1 The isolation and polarization of the past couple of decades is what got us the extremism we have today.
787840458831519745,2016-10-17 02:19:37,"@esacrosa no, i meant that cutting off people over much more minor differences is how we got such an extremely bad candidate."

787839710307586048,2016-10-17 02:16:38,@jackiehluo Trump's racism and sexism disgust me. But the way to make it better is not to shun all his supporters. We need the opposite.
787839280999575552,2016-10-17 02:14:56,@EricaJoy And sometimes a position a candidate holds is so abhorrent it feels impossible to consider anything else.
787839097259778048,2016-10-17 02:14:12,"@EricaJoy I think it's draining and sometimes dangerous to engage, and that sometimes it feels beyond hope. I feel that myself often."

787838473495465984,2016-10-17 02:11:44,@esacrosa cutting off viewpoints is what got us to a candidate that supports open racism and and abuse of women in the first place.
787835483208294401,2016-10-17 01:59:51,"10) All that said, I understand why emotions are as high as they are about this, and I understand though disagree with people who cut ties."
787835233521377280,2016-10-17 01:58:51,9) Sometimes the hardest and most important thing is to sit down with a friend and try to teach instead of yelling.
787834793958322176,2016-10-17 01:57:06,"8) I don't ascribe all beliefs politicians hold to their supporters, although sometimes that really gets tested."
787834725498880000,2016-10-17 01:56:50,"7) Also, PG and I have contibutred more this election cycle than Peter has (as far as we know)."
787834646461452292,2016-10-17 01:56:31,6) Diversity of opinion is painful but critical to the health of a democratic society. We can't start purging people for political support.
787834522180079616,2016-10-17 01:56:02,5) Cutting off opposing viewpoints leads to extremism and will not get us the country we want.
787834428064083968,2016-10-17 01:55:39,"4) We need to talk to each other more, not less.  Most people think roughly half the country is severely misguided."
787834386393632768,2016-10-17 01:55:29,3.5) That's a dangerous path to start down.
787834278478422016,2016-10-17 01:55:03,3) Thiel is a high profile supporter of Trump. I disagree with this. YC is not going to fire someone for supporting a major party nominee.
787834062291345408,2016-10-17 01:54:12,"2) I think he's absuvie, erratic, and prone to fits or rage. I think he is unfit to be President and would be a threat to national security."
787833953369464836,2016-10-17 01:53:46,1) I am voting against Trump because I believe the principles he stands for represent an unacceptable threat to America.

568229591380160512,2015-02-19 02:04:26,"8) while it's true that if everything is going amazing well a high burn rate won't hurt much, most startups go through a trough of sorrow"
568229372911431680,2015-02-19 02:03:34,"7) anyway, founders would do well to remember that having an almost comically low burn in the early days work more often than the opposite"
568229069810049024,2015-02-19 02:02:22,"6) founders seem to think ""well we need money and the press loves us, so we'll be able to raise more for sure"""
568228866436628480,2015-02-19 02:01:33,5) this meets cold reality when companies try to raise money again w/little traction and a $150k a month burn rate--often means death
568228671879688192,2015-02-19 02:00:47,4) and seed money is so easy to raise in the current environment that founders assume they can just raise more money whenever they want
568228513028792321,2015-02-19 02:00:09,3) but every small increase in burn ramps up the company's willingness to spend in subtle ways
568228430291955712,2015-02-19 01:59:49,2) it ends up being especially bad for startups where either the founders need big salaries or are non-technical and need to hire right away
